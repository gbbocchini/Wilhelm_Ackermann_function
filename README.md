# Advice: use only positive integers, most systems have stack protection...but you never know.

If no result is shown, it´s because your system is protecting the memory stack, if your computer crashes or takes a looooong time, it´s because your stack is unprotected and it is trying to figure out the mess. It can (and will) eventualy crash also, lol

# The more RAM you have, more results you will see!

Cheers!
